Language: Python 3
Ext. dependencies: Numpy, Matplolib, pyshark, deepcopy
Author: Emma Boulesteix

This script uses COAP-containing .pcap radio logs obtained via cooja sim to compute the following performance characteristics for the test run:
- PDR
- End to End Latency
- Throughput

### HOW TO ###

1. run $python .\read_logs.py <radiolog.pcap> <node_count> <hist_bin_count>
2. wait :3
3. data is provided in terminal and as graphical plot

args:

- <radiolog.pcap>: directory of pcap radio log. should contain ".pcap" extension in argument
- <node_count>: number of shelves in system. Purely for display purposes
- <hist_bin_count>: number of bins to use for displayed histograms. feel free to tune.
